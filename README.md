# Two Notes Program

### Installation Instructions

This project uses Gradle through "Gradle Wrapper". The JDK requires version 17 using IntelliJ IDEA.

To download the JDK, go to "File" > "Settings" > "Build, Execution, Deployment" > "Build Tools" > "Gradle".
Then in the pane on the right near the bottom there is a dropdown menu labeled "Gradle JVM". Click on the 
dropdown, then on "+ Add SDK" -> "Download JDK". In the new popup select 17 for version and then for version 
select "Eclipse Temurin (AdoptOpenJDK HotSpot) 17.0.4". If you have a Mac with Apple Silicon select
"Eclipse Temurin (AdoptOpenJDK HotSpot) 17.0.4 aarch64".

Additonal Note: On build.gradle, ensure that the version is '20.0.1' inside `javafx{...}` block.

### Current Problems:
The project GitHub is currently having version conflicts.
This version should be the most recent update of Collin's appended changes to the project.
